- I may be able to create a Python program that scans files in folders/subfolders looking for patterns that match sensitive information. I can model it after my profanity checker application, I think. Will need to expand my Regex skills though. Some things I will need to think about:
	- Potential libraries
		- [DataProfiler](https://github.com/capitalone/DataProfiler)
	- Scan file types:
		- PDF
		- Word
		- Excel
		- Text
		- .csv
	- Identify patterns for sensitive information (review OCIO policy):
		- SSN
		- EMPLID
		- Bank Account Numbers
	- Ensure that all subfolders are included in the scan
	- When one instance is found then the scan can move on
	- Log all files in an Excel file
		- Filename
		- File path
